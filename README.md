# Hi!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas, I'm 28 years old, and I started my coding journey a few years ago.

I honestly fell in love with web development! I currently have a 2 years experience as a fullstack developer, and I'm enjoying it a lot. Just thinking about all the possibilities that I can try to turn into reality keeps me excited 98% of the day (the other 2% is when I'm solving bugs).

And let me tell you, the developer community is amazing. If I had known that the development world was like this years ago, I would have started coding much earlier. But anyway, that's enough about my brief story. :)

You`re welcome to check my repositories, even the forgotten ones ðŸ˜…

Nice meeting you!
