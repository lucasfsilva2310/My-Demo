# Ye-loo!

### How are you?
### I´m fine too, thanks!

My name is Lucas, I´m 26 years old, and i started my coding life a few years ago.

I honestly fell in love with web development! I just have the Front-end knowledge yet, but I´m enjoyin a lot! Just by thinking about all the possibilities that I can at least try to turn into reality, It keeps me hyped 98% of my day ( the others 2% it´s when I´m solving bugs ).

And the community is SO awesome. Man, if I knew that the development world was like that years ago, I would start coding waaay before. But anyway, That´s enough for my brief story :) 

At the moment I´m end-to-end studying React, and getting better at vanilla javascript as well. Other technologies I currently know are HTML, CSS and Python. I know a few libraries too, like grommet, styled-components, Material UI and so on.

It was nice to meet you!! See you at my repositores ( or at yours ! )
